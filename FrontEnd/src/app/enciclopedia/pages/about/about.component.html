                    An animal species is considered endangered when its existence and reproduction cannot develop anywhere in the world. In other words, it can never be seen again. This is generally due to the termination of a resource on which each and every species depends, either by human action, such as illegal hunting or indiscriminate felling of trees, or simply by changes in the ecosystem of the species that are the result of fortuitous events, such as climate change.
